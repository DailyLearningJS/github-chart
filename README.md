If you would like to hack on this, you need to install compass, when you change the ```.scss``` file in ```DEV```, run 

```
compass compile --output-style compressed --force
```
You can hack on the website of GitHub or just use my demo file in ```DEV```, it relies on my personal github commits data and needs less run time;
